# WEBVAT
College minor project 

WEBVAT is a tool designed to scan and identify common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), in PHP-based web applications. It helps detect potential security flaws in the code to prevent attacks and ensure a more secure web environment.

Features

Scans PHP files for potential vulnerabilities.
Detects SQL Injection patterns by analyzing code with user inputs.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) detection capabilities in development.
Generates a comprehensive vulnerability report after each scan.
Save reports in JSON format for further analysis.
Technologies Used

Python: Primary programming language for the scanning tool.
Regular Expressions (Regex): Used to identify potential vulnerable patterns in the code.
Flask (optional): Can be used for future web interface integration.
GitHub: Version control and project management.
